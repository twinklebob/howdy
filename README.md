# HOWDY

This is designed as a really basic all-in-one view of today. It could be used in classrooms, or in care homes. It may also be useful as a quick view from a users device homescreen. It's early days, but hopefully it'll be useful for someone.

## To set up for development

1. Download the repo
1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `php vendor/bin/homestead make`
1. Run `vagrant up`

You should be up and running :+1:

## Roadmap

1. Add more cards
1. Add flex view to put the cards side by side on suitable displays
1. Add login, to provide the ability to select/deselect cards depending on requirements
1. Enable configuring colours
1. Make it a PWA so it can live as an icon on the homescreen
